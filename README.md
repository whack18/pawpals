## Pawpals
Paw Pals is the app you need to find a companion for your four-legged buddy!  
Simply sign up, then enter a description and a few photos of you and your pup into the app. 
Check the boxes for what kind of encounter you're hoping to set up (play date, social training, etc), 
then a list of potential matches will be shown. You can choose which user you would like to contact to set 
up a play date. Matching can also be by username/qr-code or browsing a list of nearby dog owners.
